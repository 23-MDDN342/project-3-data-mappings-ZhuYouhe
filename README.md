## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

Final
The TV's 'test pattern' screen reminds me of the old times, as well as nowadays' life. Human are kidnapped by 'screen' since the first TV was invented till today. We cannot leave 'screen', from TV to cellphone, we face it everyday. The 'test pattern' is interesting to me. Sometimes I feel like my face has became a screen, the past has past with nothing to show and the future is still waiting.

Mappings:
Screen colour: Reflect to face colour tone
Screen corner: Round corner for female, sharper corner for male
Antenna colour: Reflect to hair colour tone
Antenna angle: Reflect to eyebows angle
Antenna length: Reflect to hair length
Knob 1 rotation: Reflect to nose bridge angle
Knob 2 rotation: Reflect to nose tip angle
Speaker size: Reflect to mouth size
Face direction: Reflect to facing directions. Screen on left side when facing left, on right side when facing right.
                * In most front facing cases, the screen will be on the left side, which stand for a normal TV layout.
